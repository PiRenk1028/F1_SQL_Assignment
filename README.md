.
Insert Sample Data (5 Points)
Insert at least 5 records into each table you have created (in case you can't then write a valid statement why there are fewer records)
The maximum records in any table should be 20, unless you need more to demonstrate specific SQL concepts 
Submit a SQL script (.sql file) for creation of your database, creation of your tables, and insertion of records.

 

Write 5 SQL queries that demonstrate the capabilities of your project (5 points)
query specifications
At least one query that retrieves records from a single table.
At least one query that uses GROUP BY and HAVING on a single table or multiple tables.
At least one query that retrieves data from two tables using a JOIN.
At least one query that demonstrates a SELF JOIN.
At least one query that applies an aggregate function to a group of records.

Provide a brief description (one or two paragraphs) explaining what your database system is about
Tables Description:
describe in brief the purpose of each table
Constraints:
Explain why the constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL) were used and their importance
Relationships between tables:
List all relationships between the tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) and explain how they connect
SQL queries and Results: For each of the five queries, provide:
A brief English statement describing what the query does.
The SQL SELECT statement used.
The result table formatted as done in class (DO NOT USE images).
